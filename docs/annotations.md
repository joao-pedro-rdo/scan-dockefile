# Notes for TCC

## Scan Dockerfile

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript

### why TypeScript?

- I think we should use TypeScript for the project as it provides strong typing and better tooling support.

- Idea for make de connectors and integrations, is make a generic interface for the connectors, and implement the a class for the interface.

### Tests

- I think in use Vitest

`npm i vitest -D`
Install Vite in Development mode`

- Use zod for validation of types
